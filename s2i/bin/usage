This is an S2I Nuxeo base image responsible for consuming a Nuxeo project
and deploying it onto Nuxeo platform
To use it, install S2I: https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image.

Sample invocation:

s2i build https://github.com/nuxeo/nuxeo-sample-project nuxeo/s2i nuxeo-sample

You can then run the resulting image via:
docker run -ti -p 8080:8080 nuxeo-sample

Details:
If a pom.xml is present in the source directory, the project is built with maven and the
output in target (or $ARTIFACT_DIR) will be copied into the Nuxeo bundles directory.
If the $NUXEO_PACKAGE variable is define and points to a Nuxeo Package, then this
packages will be installed during the image build. 
If a nuxeo.conf file is found at the root of the source, then its content will be
appended to the nuxeo.conf file.
The default Maven build arguments can be overridden by setting MAVEN_ARGS via the "--env" argument to S2I
The default Maven build arguments can be appended by setting MAVEN_ARGS_APPEND.
